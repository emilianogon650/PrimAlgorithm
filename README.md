# PrimAlgorithm
# Prim's Algorithm Implementation

## Description

This project demonstrates Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph.

It includes:
- A **manual implementation** using Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures.
- A **graph library version** using `networkx`.

## Dataset

I simulated a graph with 20 nodes and randomly generated edge weights and connections. Each edge weight represents the "cost" of connecting two nodes (e.g., laying down cables between cities or routers).

## Files

- `PrimCode.py`: Implements Prim's algorithm without using any graph libraries.
- `PrimCode2.py`: Uses NetworkX to run Prim's algorithm and visualize the MST.
- `README.md`: Explanation for project.
